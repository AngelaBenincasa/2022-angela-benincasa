        <h1>Hi! I'm Angela Benincasa.</h1>
        <h3>Insert compelling intro that tells us who you are and your job goal here.</h3>
        <p>I'm a former fashion designer embarking on my second career in tech as a web developer.
          I'm a dedicated self-starter, with a desire to lend my detail-oriented new tech skills to a company whose mission aligns with my goal to make a positive impact on the world.
          I've loved computers, video games and technology since I was very young. However, my interest in coding websites stemmed from the first website I designed myself using a template site,
          Squarespace, for my former stationery design company. I had a vision in my mind of the layout and animations I wanted for my company site, and was disappointed to find that the options
          offered to me through Squarespace were limited. I spent weeks searching online for the code needed to bring my imagined website to life, using the custom code writing software built into
          my Squarespace template. I found more excitement and enjoyment customizing my company website than I did from actually doing my stationery designs.  From there, I was hooked, and wanted
          to learn more about how websites work, and what the coding languages mean. The career opportunities that exist in the tech field speak more closely to my values and ultimately are what
          inspired me to pursue a career change. I love that the tech field is future-focused, that there's a growing need for developers in the world, and that there's a variety of different
          companies to work for. My ideal future employer's mission would ideally satisfy one of my values, such as protecting the environment, empowering women and minorities, or inventing new
          solutions for a modern world; all while offering flexibility, work-life balance, and a fun, team-oriented place to work. Many companies I'm truly inspired by, that are doing great things
          for the world and have a good reputation as an employer, have opportunities for passionate web developers but not fashion designers. Finally, I love that the tech field is constantly
          changing and evolving.  I enjoy being a life-long learner, and believe it is imperative to living an exciting and fulfilled life. Instead of binge-watching the latest TV shows to unwind,
          I would much rather spend my free time building towns and exploring new biomes in my favorite video game, Minecraft, with my husband, Joe.</p>
        <p><em>I can't wait to work with you!</em></p>
